-- SQL QUERIES ON ALLOCINE TV SERIES DATA
-- This SQL code is designed to explore and analyze the AlloCin√© TV series data by first creating a database and table structure, importing the dataset, and then running a variety of queries. These queries help answer important questions, such as the number of series in each category, top-rated series, and relationships between variables like duration and audience ratings.
-- The insights can be further used for statistical or machine learning analysis after exporting relevant data from the database (e.g. 'analysis.Rmd').

-- 1. Creating a Database and Table
-- Create the database and switch to it
CREATE DATABASE SeriesDB;
USE SeriesDB;

-- Create the series table with appropriate columns
CREATE TABLE series (
	id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,                -- Unique ID for each series
	title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,                      -- Series title
	status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL,                  -- Status of the series (e.g., Ongoing, Canceled)
	period VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL,                  -- Time period the series aired (e.g., 2010 - 2014)
	duration INT DEFAULT NULL,                        -- Duration of each episode in minutes

	channel VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL,                -- Original TV channel for the series
	press_rating DECIMAL(2, 1) DEFAULT NULL,          -- Average press rating for the series
	press_critics INT DEFAULT NULL,                   -- Number of press reviews
	audience_rating DECIMAL(2, 1) DEFAULT NULL,       -- Average audience rating for the series
	seasons_nb INT DEFAULT NULL,                      -- Number of seasons
